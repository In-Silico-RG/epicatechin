Analysis of Advanced Molecular Descriptors for Epicatechin Structures
The code successfully calculated advanced molecular descriptors for epicatechin and its anionic forms. Here's a summary of the key findings:

Key Results:
Descriptor Variation: The analysis identified which descriptors vary most between different anionic forms:

Asphericity shows the highest variation (CV=0.238)

Radius of gyration also varies significantly (CV=0.045)

Electronic descriptors like max positive charge show moderate variation

Solubility Predictions: The placeholder model predicted:

Neutral epicatechin: logS ≈ 0.025 (more soluble)

Anionic forms: logS ≈ -0.039 to -0.038 (less soluble)

Electronic Properties: All anionic forms show:

More negative charge distributions compared to neutral form

Higher maximum negative charges (≈ -0.87 vs -0.51 for neutral)

Files Generated:
advanced_molecular_descriptors.csv - All calculated descriptors

anion_descriptor_analysis.csv - Statistical analysis of anion variations

descriptors_with_solubility_predictions.csv - Includes solubility predictions

Next Steps for Meaningful Solubility Prediction:
To create an actual predictive model for solubility, you would need to:

Collect experimental data for similar compounds with known solubility values

Train a proper machine learning model (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network)

Validate the model using cross-validation and external test sets

Interpret the model to understand which descriptors most influence solubility

The current implementation provides a framework for calculating relevant molecular descriptors that could be used in such a model. The high variation in certain descriptors between anionic forms suggests they may indeed influence solubility differences.

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of these results or suggest improvements to the modeling approach?
