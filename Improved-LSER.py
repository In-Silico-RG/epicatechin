Analysis of LSER Solubility Predictions for Epicatechin
The LSER solubility predictions show some interesting patterns, but the values appear to be unrealistically low. Let's analyze what these results might mean and how we can improve the predictions.

Understanding the Results
The predicted logS values range from approximately -35 to -40, which would correspond to extremely low solubilities:

logS = -40 means a solubility of 10⁻⁴⁰ M, which is essentially zero

For reference, most drug-like molecules have logS values between -6 and 1

This suggests there may be issues with our LSER model or descriptor calculations.

Potential Issues
Parameter Scaling: The Abraham parameters we used might be scaled differently than our descriptor calculations

Ionic Species: Standard LSER parameters are typically developed for neutral molecules, not ions

Descriptor Calculation: Our approximations for some descriptors may not be accurate

Parameter Applicability: The parameters might not be appropriate for molecules with many H-bond donors/acceptors like epicatechin

Improved Approach
Let's implement a more robust LSER approach with better descriptor calculations:
